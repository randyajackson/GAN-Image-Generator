# GAN-Image-Generator
First GAN image creation project.
My goal is to create a GAN to create images and learn along the way how to improve this process.
The next project idea is to generate video using GANs.
The goal project is to generate audio field recordings using GANs.

This is a baseline generation using a 64x64 crop of dog images.
The desired result is a 512x512 image generation.
